## Overview

ðŸš§ *The SDK is currently undergoing heavy development with frequent changes, because of this the current major version is zero (v0.x.x)* ðŸš§

Durianpay is a payments platform and aggregator which helps business to connect with different payment service providers (PSPs) and gateways.

Durianpay provides SDKs in several programming languages but not Go. Because of this, this SDK was created.

For more information, visit the [DurianPay API Official documentation](https://durianpay.id/docs/api/).


## Installation

Make sure you are using go version `1.18` or later

```bash
go get github.com/abmid/dpay-sdk-go
```

## Documentation

```go
package main

import (
	"context"

	durianpay "github.com/abmid/dpay-sdk-go"
	"github.com/abmid/dpay-sdk-go/client"
)

func main() {
	// Init client to access all difference resources
	c := client.NewClient(client.Options{
		ServerKey: "XXX-XXX",
	})

	//----------------------------------------------
	// Example Validate Disbursement
	//----------------------------------------------
	payload := durianpay.DisbursementValidatePayload{
		XIdempotencyKey: "c128fc41-46e7-42fd-93ef-cb147a8f96c8",
		AccountNumber:   "12345678",
		BankCode:        "bca",
	}

	res, err := c.Disbursement.Validate(context.Background(), payload)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle error
	}
}
```

Below is an example of implementing Idempotent Request (X-Idempotency-Key and idempotency_key) in this SDK, for the differences between `X-Idempotency-Key` and `idempotency_key` you can read in the [Idempotent Request Implementation Guide](https://durianpay.id/docs/integration/disbursements/idempotent/)

```go
  payload := durianpay.DisbursementPayload{
    XIdempotencyKey: "c128fc41-46e7-42fd-93ef-cb147a8f96c8",
    IdempotencyKey:  "1",
    Name:            "Test Name",
    Description:     "Test Desc",
    Items: []durianpay.DisbursementItemPayload{
      {
        AccountOwnerName: "Goodman",
        BankCode:         "bca",
        Amount:           "10000",
        AccountNumber:    "222444",
        EmailRecipient:   "goodman@domain.com",
        PhoneNumber:      "081234567890",
        Notes:            "Salary",
      },
    },
  }

  // Without params
  res, err := c.Disbursement.Submit(context.TODO(), payload, nil)
  if err != nil {
    // Handle error
  }
```
