## Overview

ðŸš§ *The SDK is currently undergoing heavy development with frequent changes, because of this the current major version is zero (v0.x.x)* ðŸš§

Durianpay is a payments platform and aggregator which helps business to connect with different payment service providers (PSPs) and gateways.

Durianpay provides SDKs in several programming languages but not Go. Because of this, this SDK was created.
